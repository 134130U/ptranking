# Objective

This open-source project, referred to as **ptl2r** (Learning to Rank in PyTorch) aims to provide scalable and extendable implementations of typical learning-to-rank methods based on PyTorch. On one hand, this project enables a uniform comparison over several benchmark datasets leading to an in-depth understanding of previous methods. On the other hand, we can easily incorporate newly proposed models, so as to expand the territory of techniques on learning-to-rank.
